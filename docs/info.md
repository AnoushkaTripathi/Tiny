## What it does

Explain what your peripheral does and how it works

## Register map

Document the registers that are used to interact with your peripheral

| Address | Name      | Access | Description                                               |
| ------- | --------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0x00    | INPUT     | W      | Input data value to be spike-encoded                      |
| 0x01    | THRESHOLD | W      | Threshold for spike generation (compare against INPUT)    |
| 0x02    | CONTROL   | W      | Bit0 = Enable, Bit1 = Continuous mode                     |
| 0x03    | STATUS    | R      | Bit0 = Spike active (1 when spike generated, 0 otherwise) |

## How to test

1. **Simulation:**
   - Run `make SIM=icarus TOPLEVEL=tt_um_tqv_peripheral_harness MODULE=test`
   - Check `tb_spike.vcd` waveform and test logs.

2. **On silicon:**
   - Provide an input rate via SPI register 0.
   - Set threshold via SPI register 1.
   - Enable encoder (bit0=1 of register 2).
   - Observe `spike_out` on the output pin (uo_out[0]).

3. **Expected behavior:**
   - When input > threshold â†’ `spike_out` pulses.
   - When input < threshold â†’ no spikes.

## External hardware

List external hardware used in your project (e.g. PMOD, LED display, etc), if any
